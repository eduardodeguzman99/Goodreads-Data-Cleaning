In this program, we take a Goodreads dataset and clean the file by 
- dropping metadata columns
- removing rows with incomplete data 
- creating new columns with data gathered from other columns

In order to run you will need the initial goodreads_books.csv file 
to be in the same directory as the goodreads_cleaning.ipynb Jupiter notebook

Then just open goodreads_clean.ipynb in a Jupiter notebook and follow along 
With the code blocks to get the final_goodreads_books.csv file.

Both the initial and final csv files are included in this folder
